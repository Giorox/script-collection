"""
Algorithm to generate all possible board states of a tic-tac-toe game using a Depth-first approach.

Completeness: Always finds an answer, the answer can be a draw or a winnable condition for either player
Optimization: Doesn't always find the lowest cost/best way
Time Complexity: O(M+N) where M is the number of all states and N is the number of moves for all states
Space Complexity O(M+N) where M is the number of states (including the initial empty state) necessary to get to the end of a branch, into a win/draw situation and N is the number of moves to get to that end state
