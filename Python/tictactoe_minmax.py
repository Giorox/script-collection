"""
Algorithm to generate all possible board states of a tic-tac-toe game using a Min-Max approach.

Completeness: Always finds an answer, the answer can be a draw or a winnable condition for either player
Optimization: Finds the lowest cost possible for a win, if possible, else, goes for a tie.
Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of moves necessary for a win
Space Complexity O(N + M) where is the number of moves necessary for a win and M is how far ahead it looks before reaching a dead-end
